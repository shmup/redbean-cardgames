redbean supports a printf modulus operator, like Python. For example, you can
say "hello %s" % {"world"} instead of string.format("hello %s", "world").

redbean supports a string multiply operator, like Python. For example, you can
say "hi" * 2 instead of string.rep("hi", 2).

redbean supports octal (base 8) integer literals. For example 0644 == 420 is
the case in redbean, whereas in upstream Lua 0644 == 644 would be the case.

redbean supports binary (base 2) integer literals. For example 0b1010 == 10 is
the case in redbean, whereas in upstream Lua 0b1010 would result in an error.

redbean supports the GNU syntax for the ASCII ESC character in string literals.
For example, "\e" is the same as "\x1b".
